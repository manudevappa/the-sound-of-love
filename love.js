When we broke up she told me that I didn't have any good memories of our time together. I do but I just don't express them well when face to face with tears. I still remember those early days in London. I still remember the look on your face when I smuggled those pills into your first rave. I still remember the way you used to kiss me amidst the lazers while high on E and I certainly remember the night that I played this song to you. Over and over again while you sat on my bed smoking joint after joint with me and laughing at how I sung this song to you, on loop, for what I remember to be an entire night of happiness that I still remember vividly to this day. I will love you till I die and I will.. but I am sorry it didn't take the pain away. At that moment I was confident it would. My heart was in the right place. I know for that night your heart was there too. Please don't think I don't have any happy memories of you.`,
